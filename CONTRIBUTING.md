## Style Guides

### JavaScript Code

Vendoor Server uses the [StandardJS code style](https://standardjs.com/). The code style is enforced using a `pre-push` hook.

You can use the `npm run lint` command to check if your code follows the style, and use `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix violations.

### Git Commit Messages

There is no strict ruleset regarding the git commit messages. They should be short and sweet, describing the changes in the commit. Please refrain from using messages such as:

  * `Small fixes`,
  * `Minor changes`,
  * `Changed logging`

### Branch Naming Policy

Branches must be named according to the following convention:

~~~~
#<issue number>-<lowercase title of the issue with hyphens>[-index if multiple branches are created]
~~~~

Examples:

  * `#17-some-issue`,
  * `#17-some-issue-2`,
  * `#123-you_may-include-2838-numbers`

This is enforced using a `pre-push` hook.

You can use the `npm run generate:branch` command automatically generate a new branch for an issue:

  * `npm run generate:branch -- 17`
    * Results in: `#17-some-issue`
  * `npm run generate:branch -- 17 2`
    * Results in: `#17-some-issue-2`
